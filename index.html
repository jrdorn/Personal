        Josh Dorn graduated with highest honors from the
        University of California, Davis with a major in linguistics. After taking a course on computational linguistics and an introductory Python course, 
        Josh knew he wanted to 
        continue studying computer science to build cool things to help people.
         He is currently studying front-end engineering in
        Transition to Tech and is also interested in social impact
        investing and human-centered design. When not coding, you can
        find Josh reading, doing improv, and practicing Vipassana
        meditation.
